# Ruby-HTML-Website-Manager
This custom Ruby Web DSL allows users to define HTML templates using Ruby blocks, render those templates dynamically with variable inputs, and manage users &amp; user-submitted data (with optional cookies, email, JSON saving, or screenshot/PDF export). It runs via a server for people(regardless of extensive programming knowledge to manage a website)
